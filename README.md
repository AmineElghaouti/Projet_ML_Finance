# Assessing External Debt Sustainability Using Machine Learning Approaches 

The aim of this project is to answer the following question: "To what extent can machine-learning methods be effectively applied to economic analysis?". More specifically, we investigate whether machine-learning algorithms can be meaningfully applied to economic problems, not with the objective of identifying a “perfect” predictive model, but rather to assess their relevance, performance, and usefulness within an economic framework. Public debt sustainability is used as a case study, relying on the IMF’s Public Debt Sustainability assessments as a benchmark outcome. Importantly, this application should be viewed as an illustrative example through which the broader methodological question is examined, rather than as an end in itself.

To address this question, we construct a dataset combining macroeconomic and indicators widely used in literature, with debt sustainability classifications and evaluate the performance of machine-learning approaches. The analysis compares a standard logistic regression model with several widely used ML methods, namely Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The Data section describes the data collection process and the variables used in the analysis. The Results section discusses predictive performance and interpretability, followed by a concluding discussion on the implications of using machine learning methods in economic analysis.
